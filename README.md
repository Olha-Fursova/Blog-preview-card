I could have built this project much easier without using React. But since I was taking a React course at the time, I felt the need to practice not just building complex applications, but even just starting and configuring a project. Creating simple components helps me consolidate my skills faster.

## Tech Stack

- Vite

- React

## Additional observations

I used a Responsive Design approach. There was a slight discrepancy between the spacing and dimensions on the mockup and how it looked in the final product. Even when reproducing all dimensions at 100% as indicated in the mockup, the result did not converge, so I had to adjust more to the appearance (by eye, so to speak) than to the exact numbers to meet the requirements of the mockup.
